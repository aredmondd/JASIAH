# J.A.S.I.A.H 
*AKA: Jessica & April's Supreme Inventory Automation Helper*

JASIAH is an inventory management program that manages CSV files and shopify data in order to increase processing speed by over 60%. JASIAH was designed for Alter Ego Running in the Summer of 2024. 

---

JASIAH operates on the assumption that we take 1/5 of all of our inventory each day of the week. This is key to understanding how she operates moving forward. At a high level, JASIAH is a CSV manager/formatter. Taking data in from one source, reorganizing it, and shipping it off to be parsed elsewhere.

## Example
Let's say we had 10 different products with 10 different SKUs.  
ITEM1, ITEM2, ITEM3, ... ITEM9, ITEM10.  

After providing JASIAH with this information, each day, you will count 2 (10 / 5) SKUs inventory.  
Monday: ITEM1, ITEM2  
Tuesday: ITEM3, ITEM4  
...  
Friday: ITEM9, ITEM10  

Based on this information, you can use JASIAH to count the current day's inventory, multiple days, custom days, or all of it using Stocky and Shopify.  

## Features
- Take today's inventory (count inventory based on a pre-specified list of SKUs)
- Take multiple days inventory (count inventory based on specified multiple days)
- Take custom days inventory
- Take inventory of everything
- Export inventory
- Reset workspace

## Why is JASIAH important?
JASIAH was the first time I had written code that would be merged into a constantly evolving system that would be used by real users. It would have to be pitched, taught, and implemented into a team of people at a real company. This experience taught me to write good code all the time, and to make it dynamic, easily readable, and fast (more than the classroom ever could).
